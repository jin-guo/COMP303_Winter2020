## Description
This course provides an in-depth introduction to the discipline of software design for building realistic and high-quality software applications. It will focus on object-oriented programming techniques, and cover topics related to managing software complexity and verifying that they work as expected. It will use Java for all the code examples and assignments. However, the considerations during the design process apply in all languages for practical software development.

## Expected Outcome

After completing this course successful students should be able to:

- Properly explain and apply general Design Principles (separation of concerns, encapsulation, substitutability, interface segregation, etc.) and important Design patterns;
- Properly explain and apply design techniques such as UML Diagrams and Design by Contract;
- Effective use programming language mechanisms such as exception handling and reflection;
- Analyze and evaluate the quality of design solutions; correctly identify design smells and apply appropriate refactoring to eliminate them;
- Gain experience on software development tools such as modern IDEs, automatic documentation and testing tools, and version control system.

## Reference Material
- **Required Textbook**: 
  - [Introduction to Software Design with Java](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-24094-3). The electronic version of this book is **free** for McGill users with library access. For those who optionally want a print version, the [Paragraph Bookstore](http://paragraphbooks.com/) will stock a limited number of copies;
  - [Companion Website](https://github.com/prmr/DesignBook) for source code, exercises, and solutions.
- **Other Recommended References:** 
  - [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-pragmatic-programmer/9780135956977/), by David Thomas, Andrew Hunt, Addison-Wesley Professional;
  - [Effective Java](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-java-3rd/9780134686097/), by Joshua Bloch, Addison-Wesley Professional.

- **Sample Projects:** 
  - [Minesweeper](https://github.com/prmr/Minesweeper);
  - [Solitaire](https://github.com/prmr/Solitaire).

- **Diagramming Tool (and Sample Project):** 
  - [JetUML](http://cs.mcgill.ca/~martin/jetuml/)

## Prerequisites
COMP 206 and COMP 250. Please also perform the [self assessment](https://github.com/prmr/COMP303/blob/master/Assessment.md) within the first week of the class to determine if you are ready to take this course.

## Assessment and Evaluation:

|  Assessment Method | When | Weight |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  Participation | in class + online | 10% |
|  Lab tests | 4 sessions (Location TR 3120) | 20% |
|  Midterm | 6:15 pm - 8: 15 pm, Feb 27th (LEA 132)  | 30% |
|  Final | TBD | 40% |


 
- It’s important to attend the lectures in order to gain the best learning experience – it cannot be replaced by watching the videos afterward. There will be random participation/attendance collected during this semester;
- Our TA will try their best to support your learning. But considering this is a big class – many of you will have similar questions or concerns and many of you have will answers to other people’s questions, we encourage you to discuss your questions about the lectures and exercises online;
- The participation during the class and the online discussion will count 10% of your final grades; The top 20% contributors for the online discussions will gain bonus credits based on the amount of contribution, up to 3%;
- Every module of the lecture will come with [exercises provided by the textbook](https://github.com/prmr/DesignBook). Those are for your practice and will not be graded. Instead, your practical skills will be evaluated through 4 lab tests that count 20% of your final grades. You are responsible to book the slot of lab test for each session in advance with the TAs.
- Missing any of the lab test sessions, midterm or final exam will result zero grade for that assessment.
- Any form of plagiarism, cheating is strictly banned during midterm or final exam. Integrity is crucial to this course and your future career. Any violation against academic integrity will be taken very seriously. For more information, please refer [here](https://www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/academicrights/integrity).
